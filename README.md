Airsoft Mask with Built-in Fan - Airsoft

Issue: After playing airsoft for a while, the inside of the mask fogs up, making it difficult to see.

Goal: Integrate a fan inside the mask to remove humid air, powered by a replaceable battery module attached to the mask.

Background on the mask: Originally, the goggles and the mesh lower-face protection were separate pieces. I modified the mask by bending the metal mesh and trimming a bit of the fabric to better fit my face, then stitched the mesh directly to the goggles, creating one combined piece. This makes wearing the mask and goggles together much more comfortable and convenient.

The Fan Upgrade: I purchased a 30x30x4mm double-sided 5V fan. Powering it with 4 AAA batteries seemed sufficient. Since 4 fresh AAA batteries provide about 6V—higher than the fan’s rating—I planned to use partially drained batteries to avoid adding voltage regulation. However, testing showed the voltage drops by about 0.5 to 0.7V under load, likely due to battery current limitations, age, or heat buildup. 

Note: During actual gameplay, I had to occasionally turn off the fan because, over time, voltage drops caused it to slow down noticeably. This way, the fan was working fine with rest periods. The fan’s current draw is relatively low (0.2A), suggesting that the batteries I used aren’t ideal for this application.

Design and Assembly: Using SolidWorks, I designed both the battery holder and the fan mount. After some adjustments, I arrived at an optimal fan mount specific to this mask, allowing the fan to be easily removed for maintenance.

The battery holders were assembled using M3 and M2 screws, washers, and springs. Washers are used to secure the springs, and screws clamp down the wires—no soldering required. Since I didn’t have smaller springs, I bent the spring tips inward to ensure good contact with the batteries. Because washers, springs, and screws vary in size, details of the battery holder may differ for others. Finally, I stitched the battery holder to the mask using existing ventilation holes on the sides and holes in the holder itself (gluing was avoided because the mask is flexible).
